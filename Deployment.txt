1). How to build and run docker container on heroku.
# install docker and heroku cli and login in both of them.
>> heroku login
>> docker login
>> heroku container:login
___________________________________
# you can create a brand new app, 
>> heroku create
-------------------------------------

# I'll use my existing app.
>> heroku git:remote quortex

# it'll add quortex app to push the container.

# now, build-push and release container.
>> heroku container:push web
>> heroku container:release web

# done, it should reflect on heroku and should be live by now.

2). How to build and run docker container for local machine or VM where you've installed docker already.

# here, we have Dockerfile but that file contains instructions to build an image on heroku, we need a different Dockerfile to deploy app ourselves. for that, we have DockerfileDev here, we have to specify this file while building an image.
>> docker build -t quortex -f DockerfileDev .

# take a look at Dockerfile and DockerfileDev.
# Dockerfile : It will copy the defaultTemplate.conf of nginx which containes the Template of PORT where actual port will be inserted by heroku via last command by CMD of Dockerfile's last line (check $PORT, that is where heroku will insert port).
# Dockerfile : it'll copu the default.conf of nginx which will simply expose it self on 80 and we'll now run the image and pass the port to our desired one.

# below is how you can run the container, replace 8080 with your desired port.
>> docker run -p 8080:80 quortex

# to run in detached mode, add -d
>> docker run -p 8080:80 -d quortex
